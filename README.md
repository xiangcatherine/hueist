# General approach:
> I presented on Vuejs, and while doing the tutorials found it to be a very intuitive framework. I wanted to learn more about it — so I took the plunge and decided to use it for this capstone project.

> I've also thought that when it comes to moods, they're often hard to describe through words, and even harder to put on a scale of 1 to 10, which a lot of mood tracker apps do. So I decided to build an app that tracks your mood in color. Overtime, you build up a mood palette. 

# User stories:
* As a user, I can perform standard user actions such as log in and change my password.
* As a user, I can choose a hue to represent my current mood.
* As a user, I can view a palette that represents my mood over time.
* As a user, I can change the greeting message that I see everytime I log in.
* As a user, I can clear my mood history.

> Next user story goal: As a user, I can view my mood trends over time (e.g., ‘On Mondays there are more blues than other days’ or ‘at 11pm you tend to feel like lilac')

# Unsolved problems
> After getting user mood history, sort it in interesting ways (e.g. 'You seem to choose blue a LOT on Mondays.')

# Major hurdles
* First off, although I did study Vuejs a bit for the presentation, it took a bit to get used to. Figuring out how to configure and build authentication with Vuejs took a lot of exploring and documentation-reading.
* Vuejs has awesome data-passing abilities amongst components, but learning how the data flows and how to actually write it was a big hurdle and really was the bulk of work and studying I had to do. I learned a lot about promises!
